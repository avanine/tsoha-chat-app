A chat application built with Flask and PostgreSQL, featuring categories, threads, and messages. Categories contain discussion threads, which consist of messages. Users must be logged in to view and participate in discussions. The app supports both regular users and administrators, with admins having additional privileges like managing categories and creating private categories.

## How to Test

_The app was originally deployed to Fly.io, but due to very unclear pricing, I have taken it down. This means that the app will have to be tested locally._

1. Clone the repository and navigate to the root directory

2. Create a ``.env`` file with the following variables, changing the values to your own

```
DATABASE_URL=postgresql:///yourlocaldatabaseaddress
SECRET_KEY=supersecret
```

3. Activate Python's virtual environment and install dependencies

```
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r ./requirements.txt
```

psql < schema.sql
```

5. Run the app ðŸ¦„
